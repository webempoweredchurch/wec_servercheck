WEC_SERVERCHECK

Description: 
This application checks the server environment prior to installing or after encountering problems with the WEC TYPO3 Starterpackage.

Installation:
-Edit 'wec_servercheck.php' to add your database information so the tool can test your database.
-Use a FTP program to place the file 'wec_servercheck.php' into the directory that TYPO3 is installed in. If you haven't installed TYPO3 yet, place it anywhere it is accessible from the internet.
-Make sure the file itself and the directory you put in is writable and readable by the Apache user. If you used FTP to upload the file, this should already be the case.

Usage:
-Point your browser to http://www.yoursite.com/directory-you-uploaded-the-file-to/wec_servercheck.php
-Follow the instructions provided, or ask for help on the WEC forums and post the test results along with your problem.
